# Weekly_Event_Report_Generation
This project was developed to generate a weekly report for Mtouch, a client specializing in organizing online events for healthcare stakeholders such as doctors, pharmacists, and labs. The report provides an overview of the events conducted in the past week and insights into their success or failure.
